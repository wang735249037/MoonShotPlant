# MoonShotPlant
This code is for the project named Moonshot.
<p> Currently(2021.10.28) The project will do the following steps:</p>
<p>   (1) read the raw tif data and conver to nii format.</p>
<p>   (2) use 3D visualization software (Morilab's software: Pluto) for 3D visualization.</p>
<p>   (3) use Plant-seg to segment the cell wall and find each cell in 3D space.</p>
<p>   (4) use transfer learning with paired data of our own dataset.</p>
<p>   (5) use Pluto to visualize the segmented cell in 3D. and use script to set the poistion of virtual camera and save screenshot to files.</p>
<p>   (6) use open3D to visualize 3D result and pick up one cell.</p>
